Copper bowl is a vegan restaurant in Germany. It is an eco-friendly setup, sourcing materials directly from the local market, and courtyards in the region. The restaurant follows a zero waste sustainability policy. Just enough food for every meal is made fresh, without over producing and serving it later. No preservatives are used.

The local produce combined with the traditional way of cooking, passed down from generations creates a great, healthy dining experience.
